# surfs_up
Module 9

### Overview
With the desire to soak up all of the sun and enjoy a life of surfing and ice cream, the completed analysis is important to consider if a business venture in Oahu is as grand of a deal as we would like it to be.  Most important to the business is to evaluate if weather in the location would support and help promote ice cream sales, not just during the peak season, but over all seasons.  If weather patterns change drastically during the off season, an ice cream shoppe is not likely to last and would decrease the probability of investors supporting our proposal.  

### Results
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

### Summary
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
