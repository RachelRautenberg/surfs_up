Module 9

### Overview
With the desire to soak up all of the sun and enjoy a life of surfing and ice cream, the completed analysis is important to consider if a business venture in Oahu is as grand of a deal as we would like it to be.  Most important to the business is to evaluate if weather in the location would support and help promote ice cream sales, not just during the peak season, but over all seasons.  If weather patterns change drastically during the off season, an ice cream shoppe is not likely to last and would decrease the probability of investors supporting our proposal.  

### Results
The exciting thing in preparing the proposal is viewing the weather consistency.  The chart on the left below is June temperature statistics and the chart on the right is December temperature statistics.

* While there are fewer temperature observations recorded in December (11% less observation than June), I would support that there are still enough observations to consider the data valid for comparison.
* The average temperature for both months is above 70 degrees, showing consistency in perfect ice cream temperatures. Even considering the standard deviation of 3.75 in December, we would still expect temperatures to not often fall below the mid-60s.
* One might be concerned with seeing the minimum temperature at 56 degrees, but I caution against that being a sticking point. Such lower temperatures don't likley happen often or the mean temperature would have been lower. However, knowing that there is potential for a few lower temp days, I recommend coming in strong with a marketing plan for ice cream blowout sales or freeze the price with the temp type promotions to draw people in that may not be surfing that day, but just enjoying to temperature reprieves.

### Summary
Given the current analysis, I would say that the investors should feel quite comfortable to support a venture launch of an ice cream shoppe in Oahu.

Additional queries that could be of interest:
  * Query of each month to view statistically the variation. While this analysis considers the greatest months of variance, there may be fluctuations month to month that would be great to include for consideration.
  * Query of precipitation, also by month, similar to what was completed during the module, so that temperature and precipitation could be compared to understand if that would be a potential factor during the cooler months or in general. 
  * Additionally, the data may not be included in this specific module and work, but it would be interesting to view data that is related to beach popularity.  Maybe there is a specific beach that is more known for higher traffic or tourism. This would be helpful in considering final location at a granular level rather than at an overall island level.
